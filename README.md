=============== Git Flow ================

1. Clone the project.

2. Create/checkout to a branch with your name: `git checkout -b [your name goes here]`

3. Once you have completed a task you were working on, make sure to: 
            * `git add .`
            * `git commit -m "here goes the message"`
            * `git push origin [your personal branch name here]`

4. Checkout back to `master` branch

5. Run bash command: `git fetch`

6. Pull from master: `git pull origin master`

7. Check if there are any merge conflicts, and fix them if there are any.

8. While remaining in the `master` branch, pull the code from your personal branch that you previously pushed: `git pull origin [your personal branch name]`

9. Check for conflicts again, and make sure the localhost website is running without any errors.

10. If everything is good, push to `master`: `git push origin master`

11. In the terminal, checkout to your personal branch again: `git checkout [your personal branch name]`

12. Update your personal branch with the master: `git pull origin master`

13. Continue coding!
